 * /0x0800C000/..." and "@SPI Flash Memory /0x00000000/...", which the ROM loader has

 * So the only software route is (2): make that word fail the test. Clearing bit 29
 * (0x2001FFFC -> 0x0001FFFC) is a 1->0 only change, which STM32 flash accepts as a
 * plain word program -- NO sector erase, so the rest of the vector table and the whole
 * app stay intact. NVIC_SystemReset() then performs a REAL reset, which resets the USB
 * peripheral and drops the D+ pull-up: exactly the clean disconnect/re-enumerate that a
 * software jump could never produce (that was why the earlier attempts enumerated as
 * "Device Descriptor Request Failed").
 *
 * The firmware loader rewrites 0x0800C000 when it flashes the app, so the word repairs

 *   - it must touch nothing in flash -- no HAL, no library calls -- hence the raw
