// measures around 36-43 counts, so the floor setting cannot reach the noise however it is
// adjusted. The noise therefore always draws as a solid band ~20 pixels up, and the
// useful range above it gets a fraction of the screen.
//
// That same mismatch quietly broke the peak and listen thresholds: both compare against

//
// ★ The sweep has been paying for a filter it cannot afford. Since the column-strip blit
// its floor is ~2.9 ms/sample, while RSSI takes ~5.7 ms to settle to +-2 counts at the
// stock bandwidth -- so every sample is read part-way up the step response and the trace
// is compressed towards the noise floor. MEASURED on the real sweep path (CPS 0xA0, 8
// traces per cell, against the bench harmonic), carrier height above the floor:
//
//   rssi_ct_u   @2.9 ms/sample   @6.0 ms/sample
//   3 (stock)        22.2             33.9

// So this is contrast for free rather than speed for jitter: the sweep keeps its current
// rate and recovers the ~35% of trace height it was losing to the filter. ct=0 is worse
// than ct=1 -- past that point the added jitter costs more than the settle gains.
//

// ---- wide span: more measurements than columns ----
//
// The sweep has always been capped at 160 columns x 12.5 kHz = 2 MHz, and the reason given
// was the IF bandwidth. Half of that is right and half was an assumption.
//
// RIGHT: the receiver cannot be made to listen wider, so a COARSER STEP leaves holes.
// Documented, AT1846S Programming Guide 1.4: 30H[13] filter_band_sel and 30H[12] band_mode
// are single bits (25 kHz or 12.5 kHz, nothing else), and 15H[12:9] tuning_bit<3:0> --
// "Tuning IF filter center frequency and bw" -- is a 4-bit field the 25 kHz table already
// programs to its maximum of 15. MEASURED passband: flat to +-6.25 kHz at 12.5 kHz IF and
// +-7.5 kHz at 25 kHz. So a 25 kHz step would leave a ~10 kHz hole in every column, ~19 dB
// deep. That route is closed by the hardware.
//
// ASSUMPTION: that a column must be one measurement. Nothing requires it. VFO_SWEEP_NUM_SAMPLES
// is used as both the array size and the pixel column throughout this file, and that coupling
// was mistaken for a constraint.
//
// So: take N measurements per column at the SAME 12.5 kHz spacing and keep the loudest.
// Every 12.5 kHz of the span is genuinely listened to, so the span grows with NO gaps and no
// sensitivity cost -- and since only the column maximum is kept, it costs no extra RAM at all.
// This is what a spectrum analyser does when the span exceeds its display points, and peak
// detect is the right detector for finding narrow signals.
//
// (fagci's UV-K5 mod maps FEWER points onto more pixels -- `i = x >> stepsCount` -- and buys
// its 12.8 MHz with a 100 kHz step on a comparable narrowband part, i.e. with the holes.
// Studying it suggested the wrong direction.)
//

/* ---- the average detector ----
 *
 * ★ MEASURED, and it is the price of the wide span: peak-detecting N sub-samples per
 * column raises the NOISE FLOOR while leaving signals exactly where they are. A carrier
 * is already its own maximum; the max of N noise samples is not. Same centre, same
 * spectrum, only N changing:
 *
 *                        min   p25  median   max
 *   narrow 2 MHz  N=1     48    54     56     84
 *   wide 20 MHz   N=10    47    68     75     84
 *
 * The peak is identical and the floor climbs 14 counts -- about 12 dB at the measured
 * 1.11 counts/dB. So a carrier standing a comfortable 28 counts above the floor at 2 MHz
 * stands only ~19 at 20 MHz, and the auto scale, the peak marker and listen-on-peak all
 * lose that much because every one of them compares against a floor derived from the
 * PEAK trace. Dwelling makes it worse, not better: more passes means the max is taken
 * over more noise samples still.
 *
 * The fix is to stop estimating the floor from a peak-detected trace. The MEAN of the
 * same N sub-samples is unbiased -- averaging noise does not walk upward with N the way
 * maximising it does -- so the peak stays the signal detector and the average becomes the
 * floor. Costs one byte per column and nothing in time.
 *
 * With N == 1 the average and the peak are the same number, so the narrow span behaves
 * exactly as it always has. */

 *
 * ★ MEASURED limitation this exists to fix. A survey that advances after ONE pass finds
 * continuous carriers and little else: at the 20 MHz span each 12.5 kHz slice gets ~6 ms
 * of listening per pass, so anything intermittent has to be transmitting during its own
 * 6 ms to be seen. Surveying this bench that way found every internal clock product and
 * exactly nothing else -- both real signals present (146.0250 and 147.0375 MHz) were
 * missed by the survey and found by spot-checking, despite being STRONGER than several
 * things it did report.
 *
 * Staying N passes multiplies the chance of overlapping a burst by N, and the max hold
 * already carries the result across passes -- it just used to be thrown away by the
 * advance before it could accumulate. 4 passes at the 20 MHz span is ~38 s per window,
 * ~5.8 minutes for a full UHF cycle, which is a survey rather than a display.
 *
 * The hold decay is suppressed while dwelling (see the end-of-pass block): one count per
